1.16.5-1.0.0
    - Rewritten for 1.16.5, primarily done by Sarinsa
    - The health regen disabling option now sets the game rule's default value rather than constantly setting it
    - Food healing rebalanced
        - Only counts actual hunger and saturation restored, rather than counting total value of food eaten
        - Now counts saturation (on its own drumstick:health ratio)
    - Armor replacement rebalanced
        - Most settings can now be enabled/disabled independently (still need to be enabled by master toggle)
        - Now armor and armor toughness can each provide absorption hearts and/or absorption recovery rate
1.0.0
    - Rewritten for 1.12.2.
    - Merged unreleased mod "Regen Cap" - similar controls for normal health.
